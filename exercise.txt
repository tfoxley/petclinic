Work through the following exercises:

-   Unit test is failing
    -   Make it pass

-   We added this new feature that provides a list of books that might
    be relevant to an owner's pet(s) on the Owner Details page.
    The page loads really slow now.
    -   Make page load faster

-   Eduardo Rodriguez (owner 3) has duplicate books.
    -   Remove duplicates

-   BookService has some poorly written code
    -   Refactor it and make it more maintainable

-   Unit testing
    -   Improve test coverage for BookService

- Are there further optimizations to our calls to the API that could be made?
