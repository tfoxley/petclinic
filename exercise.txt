Work through the following exercises:

-   Unit test is incorrect
    -   Fix it to assert the proper data

-   We added this new feature that provides a list of books that might
    be relevant to an owner's pet(s) on the Owner Details page.
    Our approach to this is not using the database efficiently.
    -   Make database query more efficient

-   Eduardo Rodriguez (owner 3) has duplicate books.
    -   Remove duplicates

-   We need to support multiple pet types per owner.
    - How might we improve this

-   BookService has some poorly written code
    -   Refactor it and make it more maintainable

-   Unit testing
    -   Improve test coverage for BookService

- How might you handle the scenario where an owner has multiple pet types?
